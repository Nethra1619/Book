                <h2>First Day at College</h2>
                <p>On July 3, it was my first day at college. I quickly became close with Arthy, and she pointed out a senior in our class. "Look, doesn't he look like our senior?" she said. She dared me to go talk to him, and when I turned to look, there he was, making a grand entrance like a hero, tan tan tan taaaaan.</p>

                <p>At first, I wondered, "Where will I find friends to talk to?" Similarly, he probably thought, "Where will I find girls to talk to?" As days went by, we started a "friends forever" group, and the two of us joined and began talking. It was the beginning of an unexpected friendship.</p>
