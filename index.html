                <h2>First Day of College: A New Beginning</h2>
                <p>The first day of college is a memory that stays with everyone, and for me, July 3 will always hold a special place in my heart. The whole experience felt unfamiliar and intimidating. There were so many new faces, and the excitement was tinged with a subtle fear about whether I’d fit in. Being naturally quiet, I worried if I’d be able to make friends or if I’d simply be the silent observer in the background. But just when I needed it most, Arthy entered my life, bringing with her a lightness and warmth that instantly put me at ease.</p>

                <h2>1. Meeting Arthy: The Start of a Lifelong Friendship</h2>
                <p>On that first day, Arthy was one of the first people I encountered. She seemed to have a natural charisma, making everyone around her feel comfortable. I noticed her enthusiasm in reaching out to people, and she made an effort to include me in her circle, something I hadn’t expected. Despite being the silent type, I found myself drawn to her energy. Her openness and humor brightened my day, and we quickly became friends. Little did I know that Arthy would not only be my first friend in college but also the bridge to meeting someone who would become a core part of my life—Moniruzzaman.</p>

                <h2>2. A Memorable First Encounter with thangoo</h2>
                <p>Later that day, our seniors called us to their class for an introductory session, making us sit down as they evaluated the new batch. While we waited, Arthy nudged me and said, “Look at him—he looks just like a senior!” I looked up and saw him—a guy in an orange shirt who seemed effortlessly cool yet unassuming. There was something distinct about him, and I felt a strange sense of curiosity, though I had no desire to approach him. Days passed, and I got to know more people in our circle, and soon we formed a group called "Friends Forever." As fate would have it, thangoo joined this group. He was reserved, but there was something about his quiet nature that intrigued me.</p>

                <h2>3. Becoming Friends: From Strangers to Companions</h2>
                <p>Though thangoo was quiet and rarely spoke, situations arose that gradually brought us closer. It wasn’t long before we took our first walk together, a moment that I knew I’d remember forever. It was a simple walk, but it felt incredibly special. Curiously, I asked him why he didn’t talk much, and with a subtle smile, he replied, “What is there to talk about?” I laughed at his response, not realizing at the time that his simple, grounded attitude was something he’d carry with him.</p>
                <p>As time went on, our friendship deepened. We went from being strangers to close friends, then to best friends. Moniruzzaman gradually became someone who meant the world to me. Our bond grew strong enough that even without words, we could understand each other. I started to realize that he had a significant role in my life.</p>

                <h2>4. Challenges and Arguments: Building Trust and Resilience</h2>
                <p>Friendships aren’t always smooth sailing, and ours was no different. My temper and impulsive nature often led to arguments. Sometimes, I would act out of frustration, not thinking through my words, and he would end up hurt. Yet, no matter how intense our arguments became, he never walked away. I’d often find myself questioning him, asking why he stayed, why he didn’t just give up on me. And every time, his answer remained the same: “Where would I go?” His unwavering loyalty and gentle heart always left me speechless. I knew that despite the challenges, he was someone I could trust and rely on completely.</p>

                <h2>5. Cherishing Every Moment: A Friendship Beyond Words</h2>
                <p>Every day spent with thangoo became a blessing. There was a peace in our friendship, a happiness I had never experienced with anyone else. He was someone I could talk to, laugh with, and lean on, yet also someone who understood me in silence. He brought a sense of calm and joy into my life, and I realized that as long as he was by my side, I could face anything. Even during simple moments—like holding his hand, talking late into the night, or just being in his presence—I felt a contentment that words couldn’t capture.</p>
                <p>Through the ups and downs, I’ve learned that our bond is unbreakable. He has become my confidant, my support, and my closest friend, and I know I’m lucky to have him. thangoo has given me countless memories, unwavering support, and a friendship that has transformed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>
